## How To Build

Activate the correct Python 3.10 conda environment using:
```
source lcls_setup_py310.sh
```

Build using the following command:
```
make PYTHON=`which python3`
```

`PYTHON` must be an absolute path to the location of the Pythong executable, otherwise it will fallback to the system's Python.
